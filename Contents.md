# Data-Acquisition

# Web scraping file
This file has the code I used to pull all my activities from the Strava API. It connects to my account, downloads the workouts, and then cleans the data so it’s easy to use. I used this as my main way of collecting and organizing my dataset.

# Dataset
This dataset contains all my workouts, including runs, swims, rides, walks, and a few gym sessions. Each row represents one activity, with information like the date, distance, time, pace, heart rate, and elevation. I’ll use this dataset for my analysis and data story.
